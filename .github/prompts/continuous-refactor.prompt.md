# Continuous refactor guidelines

This document outlines the practices, processes, and best practices for continuous refactor in our game project. Regular refactor improves code quality, maintainability, and scalability, and helps to ensure that our project remains agile as new features are added.

## Overview

Continuous refactor is an ongoing process of improving the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. In our game project, this approach is critical to manage technical debt, enhance performance, and facilitate the integration of new features.

## Goals of continuous refactor

- **Maintain code quality:** Keep code clean, readable, and well-organized.
- **Reduce technical debt:** Regularly address issues that could lead to larger problems in the future.
- **Improve performance:** Enhance efficiency by optimizing code paths and algorithms.
- **Increase flexibility:** Make it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.
- **Enhance collaboration:** Enable team members to understand and contribute to the codebase more effectively.

## When to refactor

- **Before adding new features:** Ensure the existing code is clean and modular before integration.
- **After bug fixes:** Verify that any bug fixes do not introduce new issues and that similar issues are prevented.
- **During code reviews:** Identify areas that could benefit from improvement.
- **When code becomes hard to understand:** If a section of code is overly complex or poorly documented.
- **After performance issues:** Identify and refactor bottlenecks as part of performance optimization.

## Refactor process

1. **Identify areas for improvement:**
   - Use code reviews, static analysis tools, and performance monitoring.
   - Document problematic areas in a technical debt log.
2. **Plan refactor tasks:**
   - Break down large refactor tasks into smaller, manageable changes.
   - Prioritize tasks based on impact and urgency.
   - Mark the code to refactor using `REFACTOR` comments.
3. **Implement incremental changes:**
   - Refactor in small steps to reduce risk.
   - Always keep the application in a deployable state.
4. **Testing and validation:**
   - Use unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing.
   - Verify that changes do not alter the game's behavior.
5. **Review and document changes:**
   - Update documentation, diagrams, and comments.
   - Use code reviews to share knowledge and validate improvements.
6. **Monitor and iterate:**
   - Monitor the impact of refactor on performance and code quality.
   - Adjust guidelines and practices based on feedback and results.
7. **Documenting:**
   - Record the targets of refactor in the `Continuous refactor` section of [README.md](../../README.md).
   - Put documents in the `Continuousrefactor/` directory before refactor to record all the plans.

## Best practices

- **Write clean code:** Follow consistent coding standards and naming conventions.
- **Keep it DRY:** Avoid duplicating code; use functions, classes, or modules to encapsulate repeated logic.
- **Prioritize readability:** Write code that others can easily understand.
- **Modular design:** Structure code into independent, loosely coupled modules.
- **Document as you refactor:** Keep inline documentation updated to reflect code changes.
- **Automate testing:** Ensure a robust testing suite to catch regressions early.
- **Use version control wisely:** Make small, incremental commits with clear messages.
- **Pair programming/code reviews:** Encourage collaboration to share refactor insights.

## Tools and techniques

- **Static analysis tools:** Use linters and code analyzers (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, ReSharper) to identify code smells.
- **Automated testing:** Leverage unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.
- **Continuous integration (CI):** Integrate automated tests and analysis into your CI pipeline.
- **refactor IDE features:** Utilize built-in IDE refactor tools for safe renaming, extraction, and inlining.
- **Performance profilers:** Regularly profile the game to find and optimize bottlenecks.

## Team responsibilities

- **Developers:**
  - Proactively refactor code when encountering poor quality.
  - Follow guidelines and participate in code reviews.
  - Contribute to the technical debt log with issues and suggested improvements.
- **Team leads:**
  - Ensure adherence to refactor guidelines.
  - Facilitate regular code reviews and discussions on best practices.
  - Balance new feature development with refactor needs.
- **QA and testing:**
  - Collaborate with developers to ensure refactored code is thoroughly tested.
  - Monitor performance and behavior post-refactor.

## Documentation and code reviews

- **Documentation:**
  - Update code comments and technical documentation regularly.
  - Maintain a log of refactor changes and the rationale behind them.
- **Code reviews:**
  - Use structured code reviews to assess and discuss refactor efforts.
  - Share knowledge and best practices during review sessions.
  - Ensure that every refactor change is accompanied by appropriate test coverage.

## Continuous improvement

- **Feedback loop:**
  - Gather regular feedback from team members regarding the refactor process.
  - Iterate on guidelines based on lessons learned and project evolution.
- **Training and development:**
  - Hold workshops or training sessions on refactor techniques and best practices.
  - Encourage knowledge sharing about new tools and methodologies.
- **Measure impact:**
  - Use metrics (e.g., code complexity, defect rates, performance benchmarks) to evaluate improvements.
  - Adjust priorities based on measurable outcomes.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our game project remains maintainable, scalable, and robust against future challenges. Regular refactor is key to staying agile and delivering a high-quality gaming experience.
